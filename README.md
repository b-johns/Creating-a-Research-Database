# Creating-a-Research-Database
This small, 21-table, easily-deployable database is designed to read in and store transcript, demographic, and transfer data on college students from several disparate sources: the National Student Clearinghouse, a state longitudinal student database, and specific institutions. Its most basic use case is to identify analytical cohorts of students with particular traits (e.g. first time in college) for further study, all with just a single query. Other use cases include querying to produce basic descriptive results about different student populations.

In the python script, the phrase "frozen files" refers to sets of flat file extracts (.csv in this case) from an institutional database, each of which represents the database at a particular moment in time. A concise database program like this can read in such extracts, complement them with data from a state database and the National Student Clearinghouse, and begin knittting together a coherent picture of students over time.
